What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that involves shifting each letter of the plaintext message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
It was used by julius Ceasar to communicate with his generals during war

What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

Symmetric encryption involves using a single key to both encrypt and decrypt the data.
Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys for encryption and decryption.
 For example, when you visit a secure website, your browser uses asymmetric encryption to establish a secure connection with the server. The server sends its public key to your browser, which uses it to encrypt the data before sending it to the server. The server then uses its private key to decrypt the data. This ensures that the data is protected from eavesdropping and interception by unauthorized parties.

How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

Mathematical algorithms or physical process. One common method of generating random numbers is through the use of a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). A PRNG is an algorithm that produces a sequence of numbers that appear to be random but are actually generated from a deterministic computation.

Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.

Encryption is the process of converting plain or readable text (plaintext) into an unreadable form (ciphertext) by applying a mathematical algorithm and a key. Decryption, on the other hand, is the process of converting encrypted or unreadable data (ciphertext) back to its original form (plaintext) using a key and a mathematical algorithm.
Locking your phone with your fingers print for encryption then decryption by using that same fingerprint to unlock the phone.
