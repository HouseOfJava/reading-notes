What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?

Static websites are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are delivered to the user's browser as plain HTML files.
Dynamic websites are built using server-side programming languages like PHP, Ruby, or Python, and are served to the user's browser as dynamic HTML files that are generated on the fly based on user requests
