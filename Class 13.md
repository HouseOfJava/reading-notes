# Linear Regressions

Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Linear regression is a statistical technique that helps to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The basic idea behind linear regression is to find the best-fit line that represents the relationship between the variables, in such a way that the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values is minimized

Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
