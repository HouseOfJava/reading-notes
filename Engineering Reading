## Discussion Questions

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

  I think I bring my background and way of thinking. I belive I took a very unique path into my career field espicially with my culture background and original work background.
  I want to be able to use this to show future employers how I think of a problem and how easy I can also develop. 
  
What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  1. Taking breaks
  2. Check aditional resources
  3. Phone/ping a friend
