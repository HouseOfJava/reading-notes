What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

JupyterLab allows you to arrange multiple documents and activities side by side using tabs and splitters, enabling new workflows for interactive computing. Code Consoles provide scratchpads for running code interactively with rich output. Kernel-backed documents let you run code in any text file in any Jupyter kernel. Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored in their own tab, allowing for simple dashboards with interactive controls

What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

NumPy is particularly useful in Python programming for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks because of its ability to efficiently handle large datasets and perform complex mathematical operations on them. NumPy's ability to perform vectorized operations and broadcasting allows for efficient computation, which is essential for scientific computing and data analysis. Additionally, NumPy provides a consistent interface for numerical computations across different platforms and operating systems. Overall, NumPy is a powerful library that can significantly simplify and optimize scientific computing and data manipulation tasks in Python.

Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

NumPy arrays are multi-dimensional containers for storing homogeneous data (i.e., data of the same type). The basic structure of a NumPy array consists of an ordered collection of elements, where each element is of the same data type, and can be accessed via an index or a slice. NumPy arrays are much more efficient than standard Python lists for handling large data sets because they are implemented in C and are optimized for numerical computations.

NumPy arrays have several properties, including:

shape: Returns a tuple representing the size of each dimension of the array.
dtype: Returns the data type of the array elements.
size: Returns the total number of elements in the array.
ndim: Returns the number of dimensions of the array.

To manipulate NumPy arrays, you can use various built-in functions such as reshape(), flatten(), transpose(), concatenate(), and split():

# reshape an array
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
b = a.reshape((2, 3))

# flatten an array
c = a.flatten()

# transpose an array
d = b.transpose()

# concatenate arrays
e = np.concatenate((a, b), axis=1)

# split an array
f, g = np.split(e, 2, axis=1)


NumPy arrays also support various mathematical and statistical operations, such as element-wise arithmetic, matrix multiplication, and statistical functions:

# element-wise arithmetic
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = a + b
d = a * b

# matrix multiplication
e = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
f = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
g = np.dot(e, f)

# statistical functions
h = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
mean = np.mean(h)
std = np.std(h)
