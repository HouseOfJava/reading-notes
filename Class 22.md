Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

here are two main types of views in Django: function-based views and class-based views.

Function-based views are defined as Python functions that take an HTTP request as their argument and return an HTTP response. Function-based views are easy to write and understand, and they are well-suited for simple applications that don't require a lot of custom logic. For example, a simple "hello world" view could be defined as follows:

```
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")

```

Class-based views, on the other hand, are defined as Python classes that inherit from Django's View class. Class-based views provide a more object-oriented approach to handling HTTP requests, and they are well-suited for more complex applications that require custom logic or need to handle multiple HTTP methods (e.g. GET, POST, etc.). For example, a simple class-based view that handles a GET request could be defined as follows

```
from django.views import View
from django.http import HttpResponse

class HelloView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")


```
