# Classes & Objects

classes are a way to define a blueprint for creating objects. A class is essentially a template or a set of instructions that defines the behavior and properties of objects that will be created from it.

Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class. They are created using the instructions provided by the class and can have their own unique values for the properties defined in the class.

Classes can have methods, which are functions that operate on the object created from the class, and attributes, which are variables that define the properties of the object.

When creating an object from a class, the object will have access to all the methods and attributes defined in the class. This allows for code reusability and makes it easy to create multiple objects with similar properties and behaviors.

In summary, classes provide a blueprint for creating objects in Python, while objects are instances of a class with their own unique values for the properties defined in the class.
