Data Structures and Algorithms
  
1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem? 
  The big O is something you should consider. This tells you how well this data structure can scale.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? 
  By ensuring our function has a base case. Therefore this should cover all scenarios.
