What are the key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project, according to the “Django Settings Best Practices” reading?

Keep settings in environment variables.
Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.
Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings

How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project?

It works by serving the static files directly from the file system, rather than going through a separate server like Apache or Nginx. This can improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of requests and response times. 

Install the whitenoise package.
Add whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware to your middleware.
Configure your STATICFILES_STORAGE to use whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage.
Make sure your web server is configured to serve static files.
Collect static files using the command python manage.py collectstatic

What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web applications, and how can it be implemented and configured in a Django project to control access to resources?

It is a mechanism that enables many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated
IT can be implemented and configured by using  Django CORS headers package.
