What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

Django's built-in User model provides a lot of useful features for authentication and authorization, but sometimes it's necessary to customize the user model to fit the needs of a particular project. The key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model include:

1. Flexibility: A custom user model allows for greater flexibility in defining user fields. With a custom user model, you can add or remove fields from the user model, which can be helpful when you need to store additional user data or when you need to remove unnecessary fields.

2. Security: A custom user model can help to improve the security of your application. By defining your own user model, you can ensure that sensitive data is stored securely and that any vulnerabilities in the default user model are addressed.

3. Scalability: A custom user model can help to improve the scalability of your application. By defining your own user model, you can optimize the database schema to fit the specific needs of your application, which can help to improve performance and reduce database load.

The main differences between a custom user model and the default Django User model are:

1. Fields: With a custom user model, you can define your own fields for the user model. The default User model includes fields such as username, email, and password, but a custom user model can include any additional fields you need.

2. Username Field: The default User model uses the username field as the primary identifier for a user. With a custom user model, you can choose to use a different field as the primary identifier, such as an email address.

3. Authentication Backend: The default User model uses the ModelBackend for authentication. With a custom user model, you need to define your own authentication backend.

4. Migrations: When you create a custom user model, you need to create migrations to update the database schema. The default User model includes its own migrations, so you don't need to create any migrations when you use the default User model.

Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.

Create a new model that inherits from AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin:
python

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin
from django.db import models


class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30, blank=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    date_joined = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['name']

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email
 ```
In settings.py, specify the custom user model:
python
```
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'myapp.CustomUser'
```
Run migrations to create the necessary database tables:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Update any references to the default User model to use the custom user model instead:
python
```
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

User = get_user_model()

```

What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.

DjangoX is a set of extensions and add-ons for the Django web framework that aims to improve the development experience and provide additional functionality for building web applications.

An example use case would be scaling up an application to meet the customer needs. This would allow for more debugging tools, enhanced authentication and authorization or entergration with popular front end tools such as React.
