# Permissions and Postgresql

What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Permissions define the rules for accessing resources based on the authenticated user's identity and authorization. Authorization determines what resources the authenticated user can access and what actions they can perform on those resources. Authentication verifies the identity of the user requesting access to the API.

DRF permissions help to improve the security of an API by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information and perform certain actions. By using DRF's built-in permissions classes, developers can implement a comprehensive security strategy for their APIs without having to write custom code for each use case.

In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

The SELECT statement allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve and filter the data based on conditions. 

```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?


he generic views simplify the development process by providing pre-built functionality for common use cases, such as creating, updating, and deleting objects. The role of DRF generic views is to provide a set of reusable views that can be easily customized to meet specific requirements, thus reducing the amount of repetitive code that needs to be written.

Example 1. 

```
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductList(ListAPIView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer

```

Example 2. 

```
from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView
from .models import Order
from .serializers import OrderSerializer

class OrderCreate(CreateAPIView):
    queryset = Order.objects.all()
    serializer_class = OrderSerializer
```
